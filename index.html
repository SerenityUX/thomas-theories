        here I will try to develop my theories of the universe.<br/><br/>
        not intended to be advice, but rather a log of my journey of trying to answer some questions that I have ignored up until this point (why are we here? why am I here? who am I? what does it mean to be alive? what are the principles of human nature? what are non-human animals and how do they fit into the equation of life? Where should humanity go & how can I progress it in that direction?)
        <br/><br/>
        <b>Day 1 of Seeking Truth</b><br/><br/>
        question of the moment: "what is my purpose?"<br/><br/>
        I'll start by jotting down some possible answers:
        <ul>
            <li>my purpose is to love. love is when a human is at their highest form and it is expressed in the craftsmanship put into a product, in the care put into a meal made for their friends, and in the decisions made to help others (even at the expense of oneself). often love requires sacrifice.</li>
            <li>my purpose is to figure out my purpose. recursive.</li>
            <li>my purpose is to bring some unique spark to the world. everyone is born with a unique finger print and a unique superpower. it's up to me to find what my super power is and unleash it onto the world (as a hero & not as super villian).</li>
            <li>my purpose is to help people pursue their dreams and bring the right people into their lives. this is pretty selfless angle & is the noble path of non-profits.</li>
        </ul>
        I like most my first answer. How would I change my life if I my purpose was just to love?<br/><br/>
        I think I would tell Dieter that he should pursue creating his laser and that we should go separate ways. It nearly brings me to tears to write this because of how much I enjoy working with Dieter and how I know I am letting that dream go away, but I know that he will be better off if he goes down this route. We want different things and I think he will succeed if he goes his own path. Success also means something very different for me than it does for him. For me, success means to be helping people and showing them immense kindness. To Dieter, I think success means people looking up to him and achieving material & social success. I respect those things and it's ok. I think if I spent the rest of my life everyday working toward something & building, I'd be happy. I think he wants to work hard enough that it doesn't have to be his entire life and he can instead just enjoy life. I have a much harder time enjoying life outside of my work than Dieter does. I have to make an incredibly deliberate act to not think of work or projects, and I think that it comes much more natural for Dieter. He's more in touch with what it means to be human and I respect that about him. I don't think I would be happy only working a couple days a week, even in many years from now. I also don't think I want people to look up to me or to think that I am a person of immense knowledge. I want to just a kind person and to help the people in my life. I am really inspired by my grandfather on my mom's side who my dad has referred to as the "Southern Buddha" for the fact that he was well-tempered even in the most of intense situations. He progressed in life based off his integrity and kindness. He treated money like a game, a way to keep score (but wasn't obsessive about it). He helped many people and when he passed away many people reached out saying he was a good man, not idolizing him for some sort of success or some sort of business knowledge but that rather their respect for him as a person because of his kindness. I think I would also focus on making this events software during the week (and put immense love into the software, craftsmanship, etc) & on organizing group hikes and hackathons on the weekends. maybe some sort of "nature hackers" community in SF. small, but a kind group of people who just again find joy through making things and pouring love into their projects.<br/><br/>
        kindness, gratitude, and confidence in our abilities and the abilities of each other. these were the principles that I decided were important for Trail. I think these 3 principles are necessary for a good community and are a good way to live life.<br/><br/>
        I think kindness is underrated. I think society is wrong in that they think the way to get ahead is to game the system or to lie or to cheat or to do the thing that's in trend or to yeah somehow win through playing the game. I think the way to win is to play the game not for the sake of the game or the sake of even winning but for the joy of the people you play the game with and the people it helps & perhaps the joy of the game itself.<br/><br/>
        loving self is almost equally as important loving other. I am a bit hard on myself sometimes.<br/><br/>
        doing someone to do something because you think it's good for you but it's bad for them is evil. resist evil.<br/><br/>
        when I get ready to close this doc and move on with my day to start working on the event's software, I get this feeling in my stomache that is a little bit like: "AH why am I doing this? I feel like I am capable of so much more"<br/><br/>
        Where is that coming from? I guess it's coming from a place of fear that I will make something small and insignificant when I think I have potential to make something big and meaningful. I think a world where organizers like Dev felt this tool helped them organize their events better and communicate with their team on the fly would be pretty awesome. It's also my first step in making software for actual people and actually helping them with something that matters to them. If I build this product with love & care (not just a bunch of AI generated code strapped together), then I think it could really change the lives of the staff & event organizers who use it.
